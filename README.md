## 🦝 Brand Story

This platform was **originally named DBCheck**. We have completed a brand upgrade to **RaccoonX** — its Chinese name is **浣巡 (Huàn Xún)**, which stands for *"Raccoon Inspection"*: an intelligent inspection and health analysis platform.

**Why a raccoon?**

- **Raccoon** has a natural instinct to *explore, rummage, and uncover hidden problems* — exactly what a database inspector does.
- Raccoons are **nocturnal**, which fits DBAs who fight fires and inspect servers late at night.
- Raccoons are **smart, curious, and tool-savvy**, matching the positioning of an AI operations assistant.
- A raccoon feels **more friendly and approachable than a robot**, which suits open-source community spreading.

**What does the X stand for?**

- **eXplore** — explore
- **eXpert** — expert
- **eXtensible** — extensible

> Note: During this transition, the project repository, Docker image, and website domains still use the original **DBCheck** identifiers, and the internal code name remains `dbcheck`.

## Advanced ability


### Collaborative Diagnosis Hub (Smart Diagnosis Center)
Hand a single goal plus one data source to a team of **eleven** specialized **diagnostic specialists** (one Coordinator + ten domain experts) who collaborate on a **shared context (blackboard)** and produce: anomalies found, root-cause inference, executable remediation plans, plus cost evaluation and tickets.

| Specialist | Domain | Responsibility |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| Coordinator | Orchestration | Understands the diagnosis goal, decides which specialists join and in what order (AI-driven or rule fallback) |
| Monitoring Sentinel | Monitor | Watches real host resources and fine-grained DB metrics; raises early warnings on CPU / IO / memory / connection / lock / replication anomalies |
| Capacity Analyst | Monitor | Models capacity headroom, growth trend, and resource saturation risk |
| Deep-Inspection Analyst | Inspection | Runs the inspection engine on the target in real time; extracts config / capacity / performance risks with severity |
| Baseline-Compare Specialist | Inspection | Compares current config against baselines / history and flags drift |
| Root-Cause Analyst | Root-Cause | Correlates monitoring anomalies with inspection risks, clusters and infers root cause, gives the remediation thread |
| Native-DB Expert | Root-Cause | Specialist knowledge for domestic databases (DM8 / HGDB / Kingbase / YashanDB / GBase / UXDB) |
| SQL-Governance Specialist | SQL | For slow / high-cost SQL, suggests rewrites, indexes, and change reviews |
| Index Advisor | SQL | Detects missing / redundant / unused indexes and proposes indexing plans for slow SQL |
| Lock-Wait Analyst | Lock | For lock waits / blocks, traces the holding session and wait chain, suggests unblocking actions |
| NL-Query Specialist | NL | Explores the target via natural-language queries to surface hidden anomalies |

- **Shared context (blackboard)** — all intermediate conclusions, findings, and plans live in one space; specialists read/write directly, no lossy relay.
- **Dynamic planning** — monitoring, deep-inspection, and root-cause are always on; SQL-governance and lock analysis join early when relevant phenomena appear.
- **Fault tolerance** — one specialist failing doesn't abort the diagnosis; the error is noted in context and collaboration continues.
- **Streaming collaboration** — the hub schedules specialists one by one and emits progress events; the Web UI shows "who is analyzing now" via SSE in real time.
- **Cost Optimizer** — ranks each remediation by cost / benefit / feasibility, recommends an *easy-before-hard* order, and flags whether a step needs a maintenance window or can be auto-executed.
- **Ticket closed-loop** — one-click create tickets tracked through `Pending/Processing/Resolved/Closed/Cancelled`, with execution feedback written back — a diagnosis → dispatch → fix → feedback loop.
- **Diagnosis history** — every collaborative diagnosis is persisted (local SQLite) with a diagnosis number (`diag_no`); filterable by data source, viewable in full, and one-click linkable to a ticket.

### eBPF Kernel-Level Host Collection
When the target Linux host has **Python3 + bcc + root**, eBPF yields kernel metrics user-space tools can't reach:
- **Block-device service-time percentiles (p50 / p95 / p99, µs)** via kprobes on `blk_account_io_start` / `blk_account_io_done` — more accurate than psutil's `await`, great at exposing long-tail jitter.
- **Per-process I/O attribution** — records pid / command at I/O start, correlates at completion; outputs Top I/O processes.
- **Per-process CPU attribution** — based on `sched:sched_switch`, computes on-CPU time; outputs Top CPU processes, distinguishing "truly busy" from "waiting on I/O".

Safety by design: **opt-in only** (default off, never injects eBPF into production by default), transparent `host_collector_source` tagging (`ebpf` / `psutil` / `unavailable`), full degrade-to-psutil on any failure, and a zero-dependency Shell (`/proc`) fallback when no Python / psutil exists.

### SSH Secure Host Collection
For hosts where you don't want an agent:
- **Agentless, no Python required** — a pure Shell (`/proc`) collection script is injected over SSH; the eBPF path engages only if Python3 + bcc is present.
- **Safety guards** — a global concurrency semaphore (4) limits total SSH; one lock per host (at most 1 connection at a time); `set_keepalive(15)`; bounded channel reads (`settimeout(12)`); a hard 8s timeout watchdog (SIGALRM + thread `os._exit`) so a stuck eBPF never hangs the session; transient errors retry with backoff (max 2), auth failures don't retry.
- **Credential safety** — instance passwords are **Fernet-encrypted at rest**, decrypted only at collection time; ciphertext is never sent to the remote or the DB as plaintext.

### Unified Observability View
**host resources (eBPF / psutil / SSH) + DB fine-grained metrics + inspection risks** on one analysis plane. In one collaborative diagnosis you can see both "disk p99 latency spiked" and "the slow SQL and lock waits in that window" — root cause becomes a connected evidence chain, not isolated numbers.

## Workflow Orchestration

Build reusable diagnostic playbooks on a visual **DAG canvas**. Drag nodes onto the canvas, wire them with directional edges (fixed top-in / bottom-out ports), and run the whole flow against a data source.

| Node | Role |
|------|------|
| Start / End | Flow boundaries (Start emits only, End receives only) |
| Specialist | Run one diagnostic specialist (e.g. Index Advisor, Lock-Wait Analyst) against the shared context |
| Hub | Trigger a full collaborative re-diagnosis (`DiagnosticHub.dispatch`) |
| Skill | Reuse a Skills / WriteGate action (e.g. execute SQL, apply index) |
| Function | Arbitrary `callable(ctx, args)` for data moves / condition injection |
| Output | Emit a result: show in UI, write a Markdown report, or send an email |

- **Conditional branches** — each step supports a `when(ctx)` predicate, so the flow adapts to what it finds (e.g. only run the Index-Advisor branch when slow SQL is present).
- **Persistence & re-run** — workflows are saved to SQLite (`workflow_store`), listed / run / viewed from the Web UI **Workflow Orchestration** page; the Reviewer audit chain is shown inline.
- **Reuses, never reinvents** — specialist abilities, WriteGate and the Reviewer all come from the existing intelligence modules.

## SQL Audit

A built-in, always-on module for reviewing and safely executing SQL against a managed instance.

- **Review** — submit SQL, get rule-based risk scoring (MVP1: MySQL parse + rules + score + report). Execution-plan analysis can be enabled per task.
- **Controlled execution (MVP3)** — safe by default:
  - **Dry-run** is the default; real execution requires `exec_enabled=1` plus a bound target instance.
  - DML runs inside a single transaction with a hard **max-affected-rows** cap; before any UPDATE/DELETE a SELECT snapshot is written to a backup table for rollback.
  - DDL is non-transactional, so only advisory rollback DDL is generated (never auto-run).
  - Every execution / rollback action is append-only logged (`sql_audit_executions` / `sql_audit_rollbacks`).
- **Write operations** from Workflow / Skills route through the SQL Audit page as tickets, closing the *review → approve → execute → feedback* loop.

## MCP Toolbox

Expose RaccoonX inspection and Skills as **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** tools so external AI clients (Claude Desktop, etc.) can drive database checks natively.

- A standalone **stdio MCP server** (`modules/mcp_server`) — Skills and MCP tools share one registry (`modules.mcp_server.registry`), so each capability is defined once and reused by both the multi-agent hub and the MCP server.
- **Chat2DB bridge** — `chat2db_bridge.py` connects to a Chat2DB MCP server over stdio to provide natural-language-to-SQL (`nl2sql`) without embedding any Chat2DB code (source-available license, bridge-only).
- Access is gated by the same risk metadata and WriteGate used elsewhere; unconfigured dependencies degrade gracefully to `Chat2DBUnavailable`.

## 🔌 Plugin System

RaccoonX v2.8.0 introduces a fully independent plugin architecture. Plugins can now manage their own lifecycle and data, enabling true extensibility.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Plugin Lifecycle Management | `on_install()` and `on_uninstall()` methods for automatic data initialization and cleanup |
| Independent Plugin Data | Each plugin carries its own `template_data.json`, `baseline_data.json`, and rule engine files |
| Plugin Marketplace | Browse, install, uninstall, enable/disable plugins via Web UI |
| Clean Uninstall | Automatic cleanup of templates, baselines, and rules when uninstalling plugins |
| Plugin Configuration | Each plugin has its own `plugin.json` for metadata and configuration |

### Plugin Development

Plugins are independent Python packages with the following structure:

```
plugins/available/your_plugin/
├── plugin.json          # Plugin metadata
├── main_plugin.py      # Plugin class (inherit from InspectionPlugin)
├── template_data.json  # Inspection templates (optional)
├── baseline_data.json  # Baseline configurations (optional)
└── rules/             # Rule engine files (optional)
```

For detailed plugin development guide, see [Plugin Development Documentation](docs/plugin/).

### Built-in Plugins (v2.8.0)

| Plugin | Database | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| MongoDB | MongoDB 4.0+ | Basic inspection (connection status, database stats, slow queries) |
| Oracle (JDBC) | Oracle 11g/12c/19c/21c+ | Complete Oracle 11g template migration (21 chapters, 58 queries, 11 baselines) |
| DB2 (JDBC) | DB2 LUW 11.5+ / 12.x | JDBC (JPype1 + db2jcc4) LUW inspection, 42 rules, system-catalog SQL |
| Redis | Redis 3.0+ | KV cache inspection: connection, version, memory, clients, persistence, performance, replication, keyspace, slow queries, config baseline |
| Redis Cluster | Redis Cluster | Cluster topology (CLUSTER INFO / NODES), slot distribution and node health on top of single-node capabilities |
| UXDB (JDBC) | UXDB 2.x | PostgreSQL-compatible Chinese domestic DB inspection plugin, 12 rules based on ux_catalog system catalog |
| HGDB (JDBC) | HGDB V9 | PostgreSQL-compatible (PG 14.20) Chinese domestic DB inspection plugin, 12 rules based on standard PG catalogs |
| TDSQL-C MySQL (Plugin) | TDSQL-C MySQL | Tencent Cloud MySQL-compatible inspection plugin; reuses MySQL collection engine and the 20-rule MySQL rule set |

> **Note:** Plugins are completely independent. Installing a plugin automatically initializes its data; uninstalling a plugin automatically cleans up all associated data.

### DB2 LUW Inspection (JDBC)

IBM Db2 LUW (Linux/Unix/Windows) **11.5+ / 12.x** is supported through the JDBC plugin (`db2_jdbc`), connecting via **JPype1 + IBM `db2jcc4.jar`** (default port **50000**). It runs a data-driven inspection with **6 chapters** and **42 built-in rules**, all based on Db2 system catalog and monitor views (no legacy 9.7 catalog names).

| Dimension | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Version & Instance | DB2 version, instance config (`dbm cfg`), database config (`db cfg`), member/partition topology |
| Tablespaces & Storage | Tablespace size, usage, auto-resize, container states |
| Buffer Pools | Buffer pool definitions, hit ratio, sizing suggestions |
| Sessions & Applications | Active applications, top consumers, connection saturation |
| Locks & Blocking | Lock waits, held locks, blocking chains, long transactions |
| Tables & Indexes | Table/row statistics, index RUNSTATS freshness, unused/redundant indexes |
| Top SQL | High-cost statements from the package cache |
| Activity Monitoring | Mon-get activity metrics, elapsed-time hotspots |
| Memory | `MON_GET` memory set, dbm memory distribution |

The generated Word report includes the unified **System Resource** chapter (CPU / memory / disk) plus a **Risks & Recommendations** chapter with one-click fix SQL, and an **AI Diagnostic Suggestions** chapter. A JDBC driver (`db2jcc4.jar`) plus JDK 8/11/17 is required — the Docker image ships both, so Db2 data sources work out of the box.

### Redis Inspection (Single Node & Cluster)

Redis **3.0+** is supported through two independent plugins — `redis` (single node) and `redis-cluster` — driven by **redis-py 8.x** (RESP2, encoding-safe). A single-node inspection collects **11 chapters** spanning memory, keyspace, persistence (RDB / AOF), clients, performance, security, replication, CPU, configuration baseline, and a slow-log summary; the cluster plugin adds **cluster topology** (CLUSTER INFO / NODES), the 16384-slot distribution, and node health on top of all single-node dimensions.

| Dimension | Single Node | Cluster |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|
| Memory & Keyspace | ✅ | ✅ |
| Persistence (RDB / AOF) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Clients & Connections | ✅ | ✅ |
| Performance & Slow Log | ✅ | ✅ |
| Replication | ✅ | ✅ (with failover) |
| Security (requirepass / ACL) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cluster Topology (nodes / slots) | — | ✅ |
| Node Health & Failover | — | ✅ |

The Word report includes the unified **System Resource** chapter (CPU / memory / disk), a **Risks & Recommendations** chapter (one-click fix), and an **AI Diagnostic Suggestions** chapter. Seed nodes are auto-discovered for clusters; on Redis < 6.0 (no ACL) the username field is safely ignored with an on-screen note. A `redis >= 5.0` dependency is required (`pip install redis`).

> **Note:** OceanBase (MySQL tenant) reuses the MySQL inspection engine and rule set (port **2881**, pymysql). Oracle-tenant support is reserved for a future release.

### HGDB Inspection (JDBC)

HighGo **HGDB V9** (PostgreSQL 14.20 kernel) is supported through the JDBC plugin (`hgdb_jdbc`), connecting via the standard **PostgreSQL protocol** (driver `org.postgresql.Driver` + `postgresql-42.2.2.jar`, default port **5866**, default database **highgo**). It runs a data-driven inspection with **8 chapters** and **21 queries** based on standard PG system catalogs and views (`pg_settings`, `pg_stat_activity`, `pg_locks`, `pg_roles`, `pg_stat_user_tables`, `pg_hba_file_rules`, etc.), and ships **12 built-in rules** (`pro/rules/builtin/hgdb.yaml`) covering connection, memory, backup, lock, maintenance, security and system dimensions — all merged into the unified **Risks & Recommendations** chapter. The SQL Editor also fully supports HGDB (list databases / objects / run queries) via the psycopg2 path.

### TDSQL-C MySQL Inspection (Plugin)

**TDSQL-C MySQL** (Tencent Cloud database, 100% MySQL-compatible) is supported through a dedicated plugin (`tdsqlc_mysql`) that reuses the core **MySQL inspection engine** (`main_mysql.MySQLInspector`) and the **MySQL rule set** (`pro/rules/builtin/mysql.yaml`, now tagged with `tdsqlc_mysql`). It connects via **PyMySQL** (default port **3306**, default database **mysql**) and runs the identical MySQL data-driven inspection (8 chapters / 21 queries) plus the unified **Risks & Recommendations** chapter. The SQL Editor also fully supports TDSQL-C MySQL (list databases / objects / run queries) via the PyMySQL path.

## Other Features

### SQL Editor

Built-in interactive SQL editor in Web UI, supporting all 21 database types with syntax highlighting, result tables, and friendly error messages.

### Homepage Live Monitoring

The homepage "📡 Real-time Monitoring" panel shows live ECharts charts per instance, auto-refreshed every 30s via flask-socketio push (introduced in v2.10.0):

- **Response Latency (ms)** — TCP round-trip time, available for all instance types.
- **Throughput (QPS / TPS)** — deep-collected counters (queries, transactions, batch requests, compilations, …) auto-differentiated into rates. Supported for MySQL/TiDB, PostgreSQL/PG/Kingbase, Oracle, DM8 and SQL Server.
- **Connections** — active/total sessions and running sessions.

**Connectivity profile for non-deep instances:** instance types that do not yet support deep collection (or whose deep collection is temporarily failing) no longer show empty charts. They display a **port-availability timeline** (reachable / unreachable over time) and a **connectivity diagnostic gauge** showing the availability percentage plus the real reason (auth failure, circuit-breaker cooldown, port unreachable, or "type not yet supported"), keeping the dashboard informative from TCP-level data alone.

### Slow Query & Connection Heatmap

Slow queries + active connections live monitoring with heatmap visualization, auto-refresh (5–60s adjustable), CSV export support.

### Remote Terminal

SSH-based, supports password/key authentication, multi-tab management, fullscreen mode.

### Server Inspection

Independent of database inspection. Covers CPU / memory / disk / network / services / processes, generating professional server inspection reports.

### Historical Trend Analysis

Multi-round inspection data is automatically aggregated. Web UI trend analysis page displays line charts with threshold lines. Before/after changes are highlighted with colored arrows.

### Scheduled Tasks & Notifications

Supports Cron expressions with quick presets (daily / weekdays / weekly / monthly). Auto-sends email (with Word report attachment) or Webhook (WeCom / DingTalk / custom JSON) notifications on completion.

### Disaster Recovery Backup

Built-in disaster recovery backup module powered by the MIT-licensed **autobackup** engine (vendored in-process — no Docker / sidecar required). Supports scheduled backups for **MySQL / MariaDB / PostgreSQL / files** with Cron scheduling, retention-day cleanup, and webhook notifications (DingTalk / WeCom / Feishu / email). Backup history, health scoring (freshness + success rate), and one-click restore points are available from the "Disaster recovery backup" page in the Web UI. Database passwords are encrypted at rest (Fernet) and masked in API responses.

### Shareable Links

One-click shareable links for reports, viewable without login. Permission isolation, automatic visit counting, instant deletion support.

### Configuration Baseline Management

Web UI visual editor for recommended values, thresholds, and compliance rules for key parameters across all databases. Currently supported:

- MySQL: 22 parameters (buffer pool, connections, binlog, etc.)
- PostgreSQL: 21 parameters (shared_buffers, work_mem, WAL, etc.)
- Oracle: 12 parameters (SGA/PGA, processes, undo, etc.)
- Oracle (JDBC): 12 parameters (same as Oracle)
- SQL Server: 6 parameters (memory, parallelism, backup compression, etc.)
- DM8: 7 parameters (memory target, sessions, buffer pool, etc.)
- TiDB: 9 parameters (buffer pool, connections, concurrency, etc.)
- YashanDB: 8 parameters (buffer pool, connections, logs, etc.)
- KingbaseES: 7 parameters (connections, buffers, vacuum, etc.)
- GBase 8s: 9 parameters (MAXCONNECTIONS, SHMVIRTSIZE, BUFFERS, LOGSMAX, etc.)
- MongoDB: 8 parameters (max connections, cache size, replication, etc.)
- ClickHouse: 9 parameters (max_memory_usage, max_server_memory_usage, max_concurrent_queries, background_pool_size, max_execution_time, max_rows_to_read, max_insert_block_size, max_partitions_per_insert_block, background_merges_mutations_concurrency_ratio)

### Inspection Chapter Management

Configuration-driven — each database type can independently add/delete/reorder/enable/disable inspection chapters. Word reports are generated dynamically.

### AWR Report Analysis

Upload Oracle AWR HTML reports; automatically parse key performance metrics and generate structured Word analysis reports with AI-assisted diagnostics.

### DM8 Offline Storage Check

Inspect DM8 storage health **without a running database instance** — directly scan the data file directory (`.DBF` files + `dm.ctl`). Supports both local directory and remote server via SSH.

- **Local & SSH remote modes** — point at a local path, or connect to a remote host over SSH (password / key) to scan its data files.
- **Block corruption analysis** — flags suspicious bad blocks using universal binary signals:
  - `ZERO_PAGE` — an entire page filled with `0x00`
  - `CONSTANT_FILL` — an entire page filled with a single byte (e.g. `0xFF`)
  - `TRUNCATED` — the trailing page is shorter than the page size (file truncated)
  - Each bad block is located by physical page number and file offset, and attributed to its tablespace (resolved from `dm.ctl`).
- **Word report + Web UI** — a structured Word report is generated with a dedicated *Block Corruption Analysis* chapter, and the same bad-block list is viewable directly in the Web UI. Reports are saved to the unified `reports/` directory.

### RAG Knowledge Base

Upload PDF / Word / Markdown / TXT documents for automatic vectorization. AI retrieves relevant knowledge during diagnostics for more precise suggestions.

### Multi-Language & Themes

- **9 languages supported**: 中文 (default), English, Traditional Chinese (繁體中文), Japanese (日本語), Korean (한국어), Spanish (Español), French (Français), German (Deutsch), Russian (Русский)
- Switch anytime via the Web UI language selector (top-right) or the CLI argument (`python -m entrypoints.cli --lang <code>`)
- UI text, menus, report templates, and AI diagnostic labels are all localized
- Dark / Light theme support with automatic preference saving

## FAQ

**Q: Some sections appear empty or missing?**
A: The template auto-degrades with graceful fallback when rendering compatibility issues occur; critical data is never lost.

**Q: Connection failed?**
A: Verify remote access permissions, user privileges, and firewall port accessibility.

**Q: GBase 8s reports "Driver not found"?**
A: Ensure the JDBC driver jar is at `drivers/gbase/jdbc-3.5.1.jar` and JDK is installed. The Docker image includes both — no extra configuration needed.

**Q: AI diagnostics not working?**
A: Ensure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`) and the model is downloaded (`ollama pull qwen3:30b`).

**Q: Oracle ORA-01017 invalid username/password?**
A: For SYSDBA users, check the "SYSDBA" checkbox in Web UI, or enter `sys as sysdba` in CLI mode.

**Q: Risk recommendations are for reference only?**
A: Built-in thresholds are based on general best practices. Evaluate against your actual business requirements.

## On Reliability and Bugs

**RaccoonX is developed and maintained by one person in their spare time.** It is fully open source under Apache-2.0, and the Community Edition is free forever, with no charge of any kind.

The project covers 21 database types and 330+ inspection rules, across a wide range of major versions, parameter configurations, and privilege models. There is no dedicated QA team and no test pipeline behind it, so **zero defects across all scenarios cannot be guaranteed**. Main workflows are self-tested before each release, but a single test environment cannot reproduce every real-world production setup.

If you run into a problem, there are three reasonable paths:

- **Open an issue** — include the database type and version, the error message, and reproduction steps. This is by far the most effective form of feedback, and it usually gets a response.
- **Open a pull request** — the repository is open to everyone. Many of the databases and rules supported today started as contributions from users.
- **Use something else** — if your scenario demands guaranteed reliability, commercial inspection products offer dedicated teams, SLAs, and paid support. That is an entirely legitimate choice.

This is a free, open-source side project. It does not promise commercial-grade reliability guarantees — but any issue raised in good faith will be taken seriously.

> Under Apache-2.0, this software is provided "AS IS", without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Please assess its suitability for your production environment and validate independently in critical scenarios.
